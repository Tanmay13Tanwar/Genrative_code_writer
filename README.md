# Project Name: Code Genie AI

### Description:
A versatile AI-powered tool designed to read content from various file formats, generate corresponding Python code, and execute it seamlessly.

### Technical Points:

Implemented file reading functionalities using pdfplumber, openpyxl, pandas, and python-docx to handle PDF, XLSX, CSV, and DOCX formats respectively.
Utilized LangChain and Google Generative AI to dynamically generate and interpret Python code based on the content of the files.
Developed an execution framework to run the generated code and capture output or errors using Pythonâ€™s exec and io modules.

### Tech Stack: pdfplumber, openpyxl, pandas, python-docx, LangChain, Google Generative AI, Python
